This application was born out of a desire to bring a truly modern, sleek texting experience to mobile devices—something many legacy chat apps have struggled to deliver. We wanted an interface that feels fresh and intuitive in 2025, with the kind of responsive layout, rich media support, and interactive polish that users expect today but often don’t find.

## 🚀 Main Features  
- **Real-Time One-on-One Chat**  
  Instant messaging powered by Firebase Firestore, with smooth image loading and auto-scroll as new messages arrive.  
- **End-to-End Encryption**  
  All messages are protected with end-to-end encryption using the Signal Protocol (via libsignal-protocol) and NaCl cryptography (TweetNaCl), so only sender and recipient can read them.

  View and post ephemeral “stories” in a full-screen, tap-and-swipe interface.  
- **Contact Management & Search**  
  Browse your address book, search by name, and start conversations in seconds.  
- **Profile Editing**  
  Update your display name, email, password, phone number, and avatar—all in one place.  
- **Custom Bottom Navigation**  
  Navigate seamlessly between Home, Chats, Profile, and more using a sleek, animated tab bar.  

## 🛠️ Technology Stack  
- **React Native & Expo Router** for cross-platform UI and file-based navigation
